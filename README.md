**The payment flow works as following:**

1.  User chooses store and order item - then proceeds to checkout
2.  Specific payment methods are listed to the user, depending on the store configuration and risk analysis
3.  User chooses payment method and submits the order

**Task Instructions**

Implement a micro service to list available payment methods to the end user and process the payment request (steps #2 and #3).
Tasks

1.  Given a store id, return the payment methods (card brands) available for it, and return to the end user (list payments). Payments can be online (credit cards), or offline (cash, POS machines).
2.  Process a payment (mock external calls)

**Take a look at the steps of the follow illustration**

**Consider the following:**

1.  The service should be able to answer tens of thousands of requests per minute
2.  The configuration information does not change often
3.  The payment configuration depends on the store and the end user
4.  Available payment methods can be offline (cash, check, POS machine) or online (credit card or digital wallet)
5.  If the user requesting for the payment methods is a fraudster, the service should return only offline payment options
6.  Your data model should be flexible enough to permit cost ($) optimizations (should be easy to update)
7.  **Gateways often have outages**, but processing payments should continue working in these situations

**Additional information about the agents/actors/entities involved in our business domain**

1.  Gateway. External services responsible for processing the credit card transaction itself. It's a service between the e-commerce and the Acquirers. Usually a gateway doesn't process all payment brands. E.g., Cielo does not process Hipercard and Rede does not process ELO cards.
2.  Sub-acquirers or Providers. These are some full-featured gateways that are all-in-one: anti-fraud, gateway and acquirer, used to charge e-commerces with higher transactions fees.
3.  Acquirer. These are the companies that interact directly with issuers (banks) and payment brands (e.g. VISA).

**Costs**
**Each of the external services has a cost:**

1.  Gateway: fixed fee per transaction
2.  Acquirers: percentage of transaction amount
3.  Providers: percentage of transaction amount, already including anti-fraud and gateway.
